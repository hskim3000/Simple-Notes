# Simple Material Notes

This is a simple no-frills note taking app with material design, meant for taking down a quick note or list. Notes are saved automatically so you never have to worry about losing anything. The entire user interface can be customised with your favourite colours and you can use the built-in search function to search for any of your older notes.

The app contains no advertisements, in-app purchases or any permission requests.

All your notes are automatically backed up to your Google account and can be easily restored (Android 6+).
